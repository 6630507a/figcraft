//! Live sessions (milestone M9, step 2 of `docs/collab-protocol.md`): people edit the same file
//! together and see each other's cursors, selections and viewports, and can follow one another.
//!
//! The engine holds what everyone sees ([`Live`]: status, peers and their presence, who you
//! follow) and the `collab.*` commands. The networking lives in a higher layer
//! (`figcraft-collab-net`), which the app installs as a [`LiveLink`]: the engine never opens a
//! socket, so nothing below the UI layer depends on networking. Without a link (the CLI, tests)
//! the commands say live sessions aren't available.
//!
//! Peers, presence and document changes are the wire types of the collaboration core
//! ([`figcraft_collab::message`]). Each participant runs a core [`Client`]: the host's session
//! document is the one it shared, a guest gets the host's file as a new tab from the welcome.
//! Every command, gesture or group on the session document is synced as one batch and is one step
//! of the user's own undo history ([`Session::record`]); undo and redo there take back only the
//! user's own steps ([`figcraft_collab::Client::undo`]). Batches from the host's server are applied
//! through the client and installed with [`Session::apply_remote`], which never touches the undo
//! history. After a dropped connection the client resumes with its id and catches up; what it
//! made meanwhile goes out then.
//!
//! A file can also live on a `figcraft-server`: `collab.publish` uploads the open document and
//! syncs that tab through the server, whose share links let others edit or only view. A view link
//! makes the synced document read-only here (every edit is refused before it is sent; the server
//! refuses it too).
//!
//! Cursor chat (`collab.cursorChat`) and spotlights (`collab.spotlight`) travel as signals:
//! short-lived presence the host passes on to everyone, never stored. A spotlight makes everyone
//! follow the person who started it; moving your own view stops following, as with any follow.
