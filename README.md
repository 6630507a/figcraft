<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="25%" valign="top">
      <h3>🎛️ Familiar by design</h3>
      The toolbar, layers panel, Design panel, menus and shortcuts sit where your hands expect them. If you know Figma, you already know FigCraft.
    </td>
    <td width="25%" valign="top">
      <h3>⚡ Native and fast</h3>
      A Rust engine with a persistent document model: edits touch only what changed, so creating a node in a 20,000-node file takes a fraction of a millisecond. No Electron, no web view.
    </td>
    <td width="25%" valign="top">
      <h3>🔌 Offline and private</h3>
      Your files are plain <code>.figcraft</code> archives on your own disk. No account, no cloud, no telemetry. SVG, PNG, JPG, WebP and PDF in and out; <code>.fig</code> files open (best effort), and so do designs exported as the public REST API file JSON, with their prototypes and variables.
    </td>
    <td width="25%" valign="top">
      <h3>🤖 Agent-ready</h3>
      Every menu item, tool and drag is a command, so the same engine runs from the UI, the CLI, a JSON control channel or an MCP server.

## Features

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%" valign="top">
      <h3>Layouts that build themselves</h3>
      Auto layout in both directions, with wrap and grid (fixed, hug and `fr` tracks, cells that span), padding, gaps, alignment including text baselines, Hug / Fill / Fixed sizing, min and max sizes, absolute positioning, drag handles for padding and spacing right on the canvas, and arrow keys that move children through the flow, grid cells and nested frames. Constraints and layout grids for everything else.
    </td>
    <td width="50%" valign="top">
      <h3>Components that scale</h3>
      Main components, instances with overrides that survive edits, component sets with variants, properties, swap instance, detach, reset overrides and go to main component, and an Assets panel with live thumbnails, search and drag-to-canvas into frames and auto layout. Local styles and variables (colour, number, string, boolean) with modes, aliases and scopes, edited in a Variables table and bound to fills, strokes, effects, layout grids and instance properties. Fills, strokes, effects and layout grids reorder by dragging their rows.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%" valign="top">
      <h3>Vectors without compromise</h3>
      Real vector networks: the Pen and Pencil tools, vector edit mode with its own tools (pen that extends and branches paths, bend, paint bucket fills for any closed area, lasso, cut), point panel with handle mirroring and per-point corner radius, join, split and heal-on-delete, the shape builder (click or drag across the regions of overlapping shapes, strokes and open paths to merge them, Alt to remove them), boolean groups (union, subtract, intersect, exclude) whose operands stay editable on the canvas with the result following every drag, an operation per operand, flatten, outline stroke, arrowheads, dashes, per-side strokes and variable width strokes (width profile presets, and a Variable width tool that drags width points along the path, one side at a time with Alt). Rectangles with smooth (squircle) corners, polygons, stars, and arcs and rings shaped with on-canvas sweep, start and ratio handles or the Design panel's Arc fields.
    </td>
    <td width="50%" valign="top">
      <h3>Paints and effects</h3>
      Solid, linear, radial, angular and diamond gradients with on-canvas handles, image fills (fill, fit, crop, tile) with adjustments and presets, multiple fills and strokes, every blend mode, drop and inner shadows (spread offsets the outline exactly), layer and background blur (uniform or progressive), noise (mono, duo, multi), texture and glass (refraction, dispersion, frost, light), masks. Files are sRGB or Display P3, with exports tagged with the file's colour profile.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%" valign="top">
      <h3>Type that sets beautifully</h3>
      Text edited in place on the canvas (with inline IME composition), mixed styles within a paragraph, auto width and auto height, line height, letter and paragraph spacing, decoration, case, lists, OpenType features, variable font axes and text styles, right-to-left and mixed-direction text (Arabic, Hebrew) with the Unicode bidi algorithm, shaped with HarfRust and the open fonts from craft-fonts plus your system fonts.
    </td>
    <td width="50%" valign="top">
      <h3>Prototype and hand off</h3>
      Connections, triggers, actions and Smart Animate-style transitions, variables with conditionals (if / else if / else built in the interaction editor, expressions like <code>count + 1</code>), flows, a presentation view with device frames, hotspot hints and an Inspect panel, and a live preview pane. Alt to measure distances and padding on the canvas, Inspect mode with measurements, annotations in colour-coded categories, a ready-for-dev list with a focus view and Compare changes (before / after with property-level diffs since a frame was marked ready), and code (CSS, HTML, React, SwiftUI, Compose) where components take their properties as parameters, comment threads pinned to frames (replies, @mentions, reactions, read state) and named version history. Export any layer at any scale to PNG, JPG, WebP, SVG or PDF.
    </td>

## Built for agents

Every menu item, tool and gesture runs a command from one registry of 400+ commands. The UI, the CLI, the JSON control channel and the MCP server all call the same commands, so anything you can click, a script or an AI agent can do too.

```sh
# Headless: render and export
figcraft-cli render landing.figcraft -o landing.png --scale 2
figcraft-cli export landing.figcraft -o out/ --format svg

# Run a script of commands without a window
figcraft-cli run build-card.json --out card.figcraft

# Every command, with its parameters
figcraft-cli commands --filter autoLayout

# Let an agent drive it over MCP (headless, or attached to the running app)
figcraft-cli mcp
figcraft-cli mcp --attach 47800
```

The desktop app also offers a loopback-only control channel (`figcraft --control <port>`) for inspecting UI state, driving tools with pointer and key events, and taking screenshots. See [`docs/control-protocol.md`](docs/control-protocol.md), [`docs/mcp.md`](docs/mcp.md) and [`docs/cli.md`](docs/cli.md).

## Under the hood

- **Engine first:** a pure-data document model and a command engine, with a thin, swappable egui UI on top. Layering is checked at build time across the workspace crates (`cargo xtask layers`).
- **Persistent data:** the document lives in an immutable ordered map, so undo snapshots are cheap and layout, component sync and text measurement only revisit what changed.
- **Its own renderer:** tiny-skia on every core for the canvas and exports, with layer blending, effects and masks; booleans from linesweeper, geometry from kurbo, text from skrifa and HarfRust.
- **Runs in the browser:** the whole engine and UI compile to WebAssembly.
- **Accessible:** screen readers get names, roles, values and states for the tools, layer rows, fields, dropdowns, tabs and menus (AccessKit on desktop), F6 moves the keyboard between the toolbar, layers, canvas and properties (Tab within them, Escape back to the canvas), the system's reduce-motion setting is honoured, and panel text meets WCAG AA contrast in both themes.
- **Languages:** English and Spanish (a draft waiting for a native speaker's review), picked in Preferences or taken from the system or browser and switched live; adding a language is one catalog file ([`docs/translating.md`](docs/translating.md)).
- **Plugins:** sandboxed WebAssembly plugins (a metered, pure-Rust interpreter with a memory cap and no file or network access, in the browser too) that act through the same commands, each run one undo step, within the permissions their manifest asks for. A Rust SDK and two example plugins are in [`plugins/`](plugins); see [`docs/plugins.md`](docs/plugins.md).
- **Live sessions (preview):** host the open file from the app (this machine or your local network), share the invite link, and edit it together: everyone's changes sync live, with cursors, selections, avatars and follow, and undo takes back only your own changes. Others join from the desktop app (invite links open it) or from the browser build. See [`docs/collab-protocol.md`](docs/collab-protocol.md).
- **A server of your own (preview):** `figcraft-server` keeps a team's files, publishes them from the app (Share ▸ Publish to server…) and hands out share links that let people edit or only view; files survive restarts and apps reconnect where they were. No accounts yet: links are the access. Releases ship it for Linux, and the desktop app joins over `wss://`; [hosting it on a rented Linux server](docs/server.md#deploy-on-a-linux-server) takes a systemd unit and Caddy or nginx (or Docker). See [`docs/server.md`](docs/server.md).
- **Never crashes:** no `unwrap`, `expect` or `panic` in shipped code, enforced by clippy; commands run behind a guard so a bug fails one action, not your session.
- **Clean-room:** implemented from public documentation and observed behaviour only. No proprietary code, file formats, icons or images.

## Get started

```sh
git clone https://github.com/storytold/figcraft
cd figcraft
cargo run --release -p figcraft            # the desktop app
cargo run --release -p figcraft-server     # the collaboration server (docs/server.md)
cargo test --workspace                     # the test suite
cargo xtask ci                             # fmt, clippy, tests, layering and asset checks
```

Fonts for the UI and the Text tool come from [craft-fonts](https://github.com/storytold/craft-fonts), cloned next to this repository (`../craft-fonts`); without it FigCraft falls back to your system fonts.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/storytold/craft-fonts ../craft-fonts
```

For the web build, install [trunk](https://trunkrs.dev/) and run `cargo xtask wasm`.

New contributors and AI agents: start with [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md), then [`docs/`](docs/).

Installers for macOS (universal, signed and notarized), Windows (x64, x86 and arm64), Linux (AppImage, `.deb`, `.rpm`, Flatpak and tarball), FreeBSD and the web are attached to each [GitHub release](https://github.com/storytold/figcraft/releases). Maintainers: [`docs/releasing.md`](docs/releasing.md) explains how releases are built, signed and published.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Status:** FigCraft is in **alpha**: about 49% of the way to replacing Figma for real work, by our own estimate. Nearly all of Figma's main menu is wired ([`docs/parity-checklist.md`](docs/parity-checklist.md)) and the core editor works end to end, but FigCraft opens `.fig` files only best effort, has only a first preview of multiplayer (live sessions hosted from the app or a self-hosted server, with per-person undo and share links to edit or to view; no accounts, teams or cloud yet), runs its own WebAssembly plugins rather than Figma's, and hasn't been checked against real Figma documents. The honest, area-by-area picture is in the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) and [`docs/target-app-parity.md`](docs/target-app-parity.md). Expect rough edges and please file issues, or tell us what broke on [Discord](https://discord.gg/artcraft).

## The Crafting Apps

FigCraft is one of the **Crafting Apps**: free, open-source creative tools from the
[ArtCraft](https://getartcraft.com/) team, each written from scratch in Rust and each able to
stand on its own.

And [**ArtCraft**](https://getartcraft.com/) itself, our AI image and video studio for artists who want real control.

The Crafting Apps share the same conventions: clean-room and pure Rust, native on macOS, Windows, Linux and FreeBSD, in the browser via WebAssembly, and fully drivable by agents.
