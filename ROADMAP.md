# FigCraft Roadmap

**Stage: alpha** · next: beta, ~28 points and ~195–355 h away (one Opus 5.5 agent; ~40–80 h wall-clock with 5 agents)

> **Last reviewed:** 2026-10-10 · **Last updated:** 2026-10-11 · **Change:** minor (text behaviour suite: CJK line breaking, vertical trim, carets by grapheme cluster; auto layout behaviour suite and fixes; Display P3: gamut warning and soft-proof (true P3 blocked upstream); several windows; localization layer with a draft Spanish catalog; hosting figcraft-server: wss in the desktop app, server releases, deployment guide; plugin panels and settings; canvas fixes: boolean hit testing on the result, group drags, frame outlines and slices; code connect; stretch and scatter brushes, pen pressure; text on a path and pattern fills; team libraries on the server and swap library; branches: create, update from main, review and merge; animated GIF fills and TIFF images; Open recent, outlines for the selection and mask outlines: menu breadth 100%; extended collections, variables import/export, gradient stop and variant bindings; feature breadth ~79%; ready ~47%) · **Target:** Figma Design (desktop app 126.10.7)

FigCraft is a clean-room, open-source, pure-Rust reimplementation of the Figma design workflow,
native on macOS, Windows, Linux and FreeBSD and in the browser, fully drivable by agents through
the CLI, a JSON control channel and MCP. This page is the one-page summary; agents choosing work
start with [`docs/gaps.md`](docs/gaps.md).

## Headline numbers

| | Value | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| Menu/command breadth | **100%** (204 / 204) | measured, [`docs/parity-checklist.md`](docs/parity-checklist.md) (`cargo xtask parity`) |
| Feature breadth | **~79%** (core editor ~90%) | estimated, [`docs/target-app-parity.md`](docs/target-app-parity.md) |
| Ready for real work | **~47%** | estimated, same doc (written dimension weights and scores) |
| Essentials user | **~53%** | estimated: core features 77.8% × 0.92 launch/stability × 0.92 discoverability × 0.8 opening files people send ([method](docs/target-app-parity.md#essentials-user)) |
| Mainstream practitioner | **~43%** | estimated: weekly areas 66.8% × 0.9 interaction × 0.9 stability × 0.8 file exchange with Figma users ([method](docs/target-app-parity.md#mainstream-practitioner)) |
| Remaining to beta | **~195–355 h** one agent | estimated |
| Remaining to full parity | **~343–663 h** one agent (~92–160 h wall-clock with 5 agents) | estimated |

### Readiness by audience

| Audience | Ready % | Opus 5.5 agent wall-clock hours to ~95% | Work that dominates |
|---|---|---|---|
| Full target (ready for real work) | ~47% | ~327–629 h | multiplayer (45–90), localization (45–75), plugins (15–40), the interaction pass (40–60), `.fig` import (30–60), GPU canvas (30–60), AI (30–60) |
| Mainstream practitioner | ~43% | ~162–304 h | core editor depth incl. `.fig` import (80–157), the interaction pass (40–60), real-file corpus and platform QA (25–50), `.fig` export for handing work back (15–30) |
| Essentials user | ~53% | ~85–160 h | `.fig` import so files people send open (30–60), core tool polish (25–45), interaction pass on the core tools (15–25), stability QA (10–20), onboarding and starter templates (5–10) |

Hours are one agent working sequentially, calibrated from this repo's history (about 1 agent-hour
per 1,000 added lines, 1–2.5 h per feature PR, ~7 h per honest depth point in the polish tail; see
[how the hours are calibrated](docs/target-app-parity.md#how-the-hours-are-calibrated)). Each audience's work is a subset of
the next. About 70–80% parallelizes across 4–6 agents on disjoint crates (roughly ÷4 in
wall-clock); the `.fig` reader, the multiplayer core and a plugin runtime each need one owner, and
native-speaker review, real-file licensing and screen-reader QA need people.

Hours are Opus 5.5 agent wall-clock hours, calibrated from this repo's history: the app was built in
~25 wall-clock hours by 4–6 parallel agents (~110–150 agent-hours, ~1 agent-hour per 1,000 added
lines, a typical feature PR 1–2.5 h). Details and what needs a human:
[`docs/target-app-parity.md`](docs/target-app-parity.md#how-the-hours-are-calibrated).

## Stage

**Alpha.** Core workflows exist end to end (frames, shapes, vectors, text, auto layout, components
with variants and overrides, styles, variables, prototyping, Dev Mode, SVG/PNG/JPG/PDF), but
FigCraft can't open Figma's own `.fig` files, has only a preview of multiplayer, and nothing has been checked
against real Figma documents. Ready-for-real-work is ~47%, inside alpha's ~40–75% band, and the alpha gate passes: every daily core workflow (design screens, build a design system, prototype, hand off to developers) works end to end on FigCraft's own files, which save and reopen; review works only asynchronously and `.fig` import is missing, both beta gaps ([alpha gate](docs/roadmap.md#alpha-gate)). Beta needs
~75% **and** reliable `.fig` import: the `.fig` reader (30–60 h), a real-file corpus with measured
fidelity (15–30 h), the interaction pass (25–40 h of the 40–60), core depth to ~80% (40–75 h),
basic multiplayer on the landed core (30–55 h), stability and platform QA (20–40 h), a partial GPU path (15–30 h) and
Figma's own languages on the landed localization layer (15–25 h).

No other languages. Figma ships English, Japanese, Korean, French, German, Spanish and Portuguese
(Brazil); FigCraft has the localization layer, English and a Spanish draft (Preferences ▸ Language;
adding a language: [`docs/translating.md`](docs/translating.md)). Document text in any script (bidi, Arabic
shaping, IME) already works. Detail: [`docs/localization-parity.md`](docs/localization-parity.md).

## Upcoming

Ranked; detail and milestones in [`docs/roadmap.md`](docs/roadmap.md).

1. `.fig` import, best effort, with a synthetic `.fig` corpus: 30–60 h.
2. Real-file corpus and measured fidelity: 15–30 h.
3. Tool-by-tool interaction pass against Figma: 40–60 h.
4. Languages on the landed localization layer: ja, ko, pt-BR, fr, de, and a native review of es: 15–30 h.
5. Multiplayer (M9): accounts and teams on top of the live sessions and the standalone server (transport, hosting, invite links that open the app, document sync, presence with remote text carets, per-user undo, reconnect with offline edits, collision-free ids for styles, variables and comments, the browser client, `figcraft-server` with persistence and share links to edit or view, team libraries on the server landed): 45–90 h.

## Progress log

- **2026-10-11** · Gamut warnings (gap 18): the colour picker of a Display P3 file flags colours
  outside sRGB and View ▸ Soft-proof sRGB stripes them on the canvas. Showing P3 itself waits on
  eframe/egui-wgpu exposing the surface colour space wgpu 30 already supports.
- **2026-10-11** · Several windows (gap 18): File ▸ New window, Open in new window on a tab or a
  tab dragged off the strip; each window has its own tabs, panels and canvas, draws only when it
  needs to and asks about unsaved changes when it closes (the main window too); the control channel
  and MCP open, list, focus and capture windows. Hardware 60%.
- **2026-10-11** · Hosting `figcraft-server`: the desktop app and `figcraft-cli` open `wss://` links (rustls,
  certificates always verified; `FIGCRAFT_CA_FILE` for a private authority), releases ship the server for Linux
  x86_64 and aarch64, it stops gracefully on SIGTERM or Ctrl+C, and `docs/server.md` walks through deploying it on
  a rented Linux server (systemd unit, Caddy or nginx, firewall, Docker, upgrades, backups).
- **2026-10-11** · Plugin panels and settings (gap 6, ABI v2; v1 plugins run unchanged): a plugin shows a panel of
  fields and buttons drawn with FigCraft's widgets and is called back for each button or changed value (one undo step
  per callback, same sandbox limits), `plugin.ui` / `plugin.event` / `plugin.close` drive panels from scripts and MCP,
  and per-plugin settings are kept with the preferences; Swatch grid gained a palette panel. Plugins & widgets 45%.
- **2026-10-11** · Canvas fixes: clicks hit boolean groups where their result is (a click in a
  subtracted hole reaches what's behind), a layer dragged inside a group stays in it, View ▸ Frame
  outlines and View ▸ Slices draw, and a flaky idle test now waits for the render thread (gap 13).
- **2026-10-11** · Team libraries on `figcraft-server` (gap 10): Assets ▸ Libraries ▸ Publish to server keeps
  the file's library on the server under the file (per-asset versions; the server's version is followed); other files
  enable it by pasting a share link (a view link is enough), get "Library updates available" from a background check
  and accept with overrides kept; the server counts which files use which components (Show usage, `library.usage`);
  `library.swap` re-points instances, styles and variables to another library by names. Team libraries 70%.
- **2026-10-11** · Animated GIF fills (first frame on the canvas and in exports, played in the
  presenter and the preview, waking the window only for the next frame) and TIFF images (gap 12).
- **2026-10-11** · The last three menu items got commands: File ▸ Open recent (kept in the
  preferences, missing files greyed, Clear recent), outlines for the selection and mask outlines
  (gap 21). Menu breadth 203/203.
- **2026-10-11** · Extended variable collections (a library collection's modes and variables in a
  collection of the file, overridden per mode with reset, following library updates), variables
  import/export (the REST local variables JSON, merged by name; CSS custom properties), gradient
  stops and variant properties bound to variables (gap 14).
- **2026-10-11** · Live boolean editing: operands stay editable layers (double-click or Cmd/Ctrl-click
  selects one, moving, resizing or editing its points redraws the result during the drag with every
  operand outlined, per-operand operations from the boolean controls, prefix-cached recompute);
  Design panel arc fields; the shape builder on strokes and open paths; one-sided variable widths
  (gap 13). Feature breadth ~79%.
- **2026-10-10** · WASM plugins (#101: sandboxed wasmi runtime, manifest permissions, Plugins menu,
  Run last, Manage, Rust SDK and two examples), docs refresh (#102), the multiplayer core without
  networking (#103: client-scoped ids, change sets, server ordering and validation, client
  reconciliation, convergence tests). Menu breadth 200/203; ready for real work ~47%.
- **2026-10-10** · Full re-measure against Figma desktop 126.10.7 under the craftrules progress-docs
  standard: ready for real work ~46%, feature breadth ~76%, stage alpha; progress docs split out
  (`docs/target-app-parity.md`, `gaps.md`, `roadmap.md`, `architecture.md`, the per-area parity
  docs); `docs/parity.md` renamed `docs/parity-checklist.md`.
- **2026-10-10** · Day 2 (PRs #1–#99): vector edit mode depth (transform box, point snapping, arc
  handles, shape builder, variable width), text depth (variable fonts, bidi, RTL names, style
  browser), auto layout nesting and keyboard reordering, slots and library variables, components
  at scale (2,000 instances), effects fidelity (glass, noise, texture, progressive blur),
  prototyping (conditionals, expressions, device frames, responsive presentation), REST import of
  prototypes and variables, SVG import fidelity, PDF print options, Dev Mode (code, annotations,
  ready for dev, compare changes), comments polish, version history, keyboard shortcut parity,
  accessibility, retained canvas and 50k-layer performance, no redraws while idle; v0.2.0
  released for every platform; multiplayer protocol designed.
- **2026-10-09** · Day 1: foundation (13 crates, layering, command registry, renderer, engine,
  UI3 frontend, control channel), CLI and MCP, web build, PDF export, packaging, first depth
  passes on text, components, prototyping and comments.

## Revision history

| Date | Change | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-10-11 | minor | Text behaviour suite written from the public documentation (13 text cases, 5 command tests) and its fixes: CJK lines break between ideographs, kana and Hangul and before and after Latin words without breaking inside them, with the line-start and line-end rules (closing punctuation, small kana and the prolonged sound mark never start a line, opening brackets never end one); a style's line height, baseline and decoration come from its own font, so lines with CJK or emoji drawn by fallback fonts keep the spacing of the others; paragraph indent applies to start-aligned text only; carets, Delete and Backspace step over whole grapheme clusters (emoji sequences, flags, combining marks), which also shape with one font; double-click and word moves take one script's run in text without spaces. Added: vertical trim (cap height to baseline; `leadingTrim`, Type settings, REST import, inspect, CSS `text-box`). Text 85%/64% → 87%/68%, 7–13 h → 5–10 h; percentages unchanged at this rounding; full parity ~345–666 h → ~343–663 h |
| 2026-10-11 | minor | Auto layout behaviour suite written from the public documentation (64 layout cases, 8 command tests) and its fixes: a frame is never smaller than its padding, only the frame's inside stroke counts when strokes are included (and new auto layout includes them), auto gaps stop at 0, grid `fr` tracks behave like the CSS `fr` unit (a track never gets less than its content), canvas stacking is drawn, exported and hit (it was stored only). Added: auto gaps evenly and around, vertical wrap, grid cell alignment, strokes and canvas stacking controls. Auto layout 95%/68% → 98%/74%, 6–12 h → 3–6 h; percentages unchanged at this rounding; full parity ~348–672 h → ~345–666 h |
| 2026-10-11 | minor | Display P3 honest minimum (gap 18): the colour picker of a Display P3 file warns when a colour is outside sRGB (Outside sRGB, with what the canvas and exports do), and View ▸ Soft-proof sRGB (`view.proofSrgb`) stripes the canvas pixels sRGB can't show. Why the canvas still shows sRGB: wgpu 30 can present Display P3 or extended-range sRGB surfaces (Metal, DX12, Vulkan, WebGPU canvases), but eframe/egui-wgpu 0.36 configure an 8-bit sRGB surface with no option for the format or colour space, and egui's renderer writes sRGB-encoded UI colours; showing P3 needs those two upstream (or a patched egui-wgpu). Hardware 13–27 h → 12–26 h; gap 18 6–12 h → 5–11 h; percentages, feature breadth (~79%) and ready for real work (~47%) unchanged at this rounding; full parity ~363–697 h → ~362–696 h |
| 2026-10-11 | minor | Several windows (gap 18): File ▸ New window, a tab's Open in new window or a tab dragged off the tab strip opens files in another window with its own tabs, panels and canvas, sharing the files, preferences, libraries and clipboard; each window draws only when it needs to (idle: ~0% CPU), closing one closes its files after asking about unsaved changes (the main window too, which takes over another window instead of quitting; the last window quits), and the control channel and MCP open, list, focus and capture windows (`window.new`, `window.list`, `window.focus`, `window` on any request); the screen-reader tree covers the main window only (eframe 0.36), so with a screen reader running files stay tabs; one window in the browser. Hardware 55% → 60%, 13–27 h → 10–21 h; gap 18 6–12 h → 4–8 h (P3 on screen left); feature breadth (~79%) and ready for real work (~47%) unchanged at this rounding; full parity ~363–697 h → ~360–691 h |
| 2026-10-11 | minor | Localization layer landed (gap 5): per-language catalogs baked in at build time with English text as keys and fallback, placeholders and plurals, command labels by id, Preferences ▸ Language (System follows the OS or the browser) applied live and `pref.language`; English catalog and a complete Spanish draft awaiting native review. Localization 10% → 20%, 60–100 h → 45–75 h; ready for real work unchanged (~47%); full parity ~363–697 h → ~348–672 h; beta ~200–365 h → ~195–355 h |
| 2026-10-11 | minor | Hosting `figcraft-server`: the desktop app and `figcraft-cli` open `wss://` links (rustls with Mozilla's root certificates, always verified; `FIGCRAFT_CA_FILE` adds a private authority), releases ship the server for Linux x86_64 and aarch64, it stops gracefully on SIGTERM or Ctrl+C, and `docs/server.md` has a deployment guide (systemd unit, Caddy, nginx, Docker); percentages and hours unchanged until the next re-measure |
| 2026-10-11 | minor | Plugin panels and settings landed (gap 6, ABI v2; v1 plugins unchanged): a plugin shows a panel of notes, fields (text, number, checkbox, menu, list, colour) and buttons drawn with FigCraft's widgets; a button or a changed value calls it back with every value (same limits per callback, one undo step per callback that edits, rolled back on failure), its module staying loaded while the panel is open; `plugin.ui` / `plugin.event` / `plugin.close` drive panels headless; per-plugin settings (64 KB) kept with the preferences; the Swatch grid example gained a palette panel that remembers the last palette. Plugins & widgets breadth 35% → 45%, ready 20% → 28%, 25–55 h → 15–40 h; ecosystem 20% → 28%; feature breadth (~79%) and ready for real work (~47%) unchanged at this rounding; full parity ~373–712 h → ~363–697 h |
| 2026-10-11 | minor | Canvas fixes (gap 13 closed): boolean groups are clicked where their result is (a click in a subtracted hole reaches what's behind; with the group or an operand selected its operands are hit, so each can still be picked), a layer dragged inside a group stays in the group (frames and auto layout still take other drops), View ▸ Frame outlines and View ▸ Slices draw on the canvas, and the idle tests wait for the render thread instead of counting frames. Shapes & vector 1–3 h → 1–2 h (vector QA with real files left); percentages, feature breadth (~79%), ready for real work (~47%) and full parity hours unchanged at this rounding |
| 2026-10-11 | minor | Code connect and Dev Mode plugins (gap 16): a component or set links to its code component per language (import path, name, a template with `{property}` and `{property ? "a" : "b"}` placeholders); `inspect.code`, `inspect.componentCode` and the Inspect panel show that snippet with the instance's values (also inside generated layer trees), edited in Connect to code with a live preview; links are saved, synced and undoable, and travel as `figcraft.connect.json` (`codeConnect.export` / `codeConnect.import`). Plugins that only read run from the Inspect tab. Dev Mode breadth 80% → 90%, ready 62% → 64%, 4–8 h → 1–3 h; feature breadth (~79%) and ready for real work (~47%) unchanged; full parity ~378–722 h → ~375–717 h |
| 2026-10-11 | minor | Stretch and scatter brushes and pen pressure landed (gap 9): eight brushes drawn in code (four stretched along the path, four scattered with spacing, size, rotation and scatter jitter from a seed) in the stroke settings, drawn everywhere strokes are and flattened by outline stroke; the Pencil records pen pressure as the stroke's width profile (Windows pens, browser styluses; macOS and Linux tablets report none) and can draw with a brush; Figma Draw extras breadth 45% → 65%, ready 30% → 45%, 10–18 h → 5–9 h; Strokes 2–4 h → 1–3 h; Hardware 50% → 55%, 15–30 h → 13–27 h; feature breadth (~79%) and ready for real work (~47%) unchanged at this rounding; full parity ~378–722 h → ~358–687 h |
| 2026-10-11 | minor | Text on a path and pattern fills landed (gap 9): text follows a path or shape (start, side, alignment; edited in place; canvas, PNG, SVG and PDF; SVG `<textPath>` imports as text on a path) and pattern fills tile a layer (grid or half-shifted rows or columns, scale, spacing, alignment; live as the source changes; SVG `<pattern>`, PDF tiling patterns); Figma Draw extras breadth 45% → 65%, ready 30% → 45%, 10–18 h → 5–10 h; Text 8–14 h → 7–13 h; feature breadth (~79%) and ready for real work (~47%) unchanged at this rounding; full parity ~380–725 h → ~375–715 h |
| 2026-10-11 | minor | Team libraries on `figcraft-server` landed (gap 10): a file's library is published to the server under the file and enabled in other files by a share link (per-asset versions; updates noticed in the background and accepted with overrides kept), the server counts which files use which components, and a whole library can be swapped for another by names; Team libraries breadth 40% → 70%, ready 25% → 40%, 10–20 h → 4–8 h; collaboration 12% → 13%, 55–110 h → 49–98 h; feature breadth (~79%) and ready for real work (~47%) unchanged; full parity ~380–725 h → ~375–715 h |
| 2026-10-11 | minor | Branches landed (gap 17): File ▸ Create branch… copies the file into a branch tab that remembers its base; Review and merge shows both sides' changes (layers with Inspect-style property changes, styles, variables, comments) and the conflicts (the same property changed on both sides, or a layer deleted on one side and edited on the other), each resolved for the branch or main; merging is one undo step and archives the branch; Update from main; branches are saved in the `.figcraft` file. Comments, versions, find, misc breadth 80% → 85%, ready 58% → 60%, 4–8 h → 2–5 h; collaboration 12% → 13%; menu breadth 204/204 (the catalog gained File ▸ Create branch…); feature breadth (~79%) and ready for real work (~47%) unchanged at this rounding; full parity ~380–725 h → ~378–722 h |
| 2026-10-11 | minor | Animated GIF fills and TIFF images (gap 12, without video and HEIC): GIF fills keep the original file, show the first frame on the canvas and in exports and play in the presenter and the preview (frames decoded on first play, at most 500 frames and 128 MB; always looping; the window wakes only for a GIF's next frame); TIFF images open, import, place and paste. Paint breadth 85% → 87%, 5–9 h → 4–7 h; gap 12 6–12 h → 5–10 h (video playback and HEIC left, both needing non-Rust decoders); feature breadth (~79%), ready for real work (~47%) and full parity hours unchanged at this rounding |
| 2026-10-11 | minor | The last three catalogued menu items got commands (gap 21): File ▸ Open recent (recent files kept in the preferences, at most 20, a file that's gone greyed in the menu and dropped when picked, Clear recent), View ▸ Outlines ▸ Show outlines for selection and View ▸ Mask outlines: menu breadth 98.5% → 100% (203/203); Canvas & navigation breadth 95% → 97%, 3–6 h → 2–5 h; feature breadth (~79%), ready for real work (~47%) and full parity hours unchanged at this rounding |
| 2026-10-11 | minor | Extended collections, variables import/export and gradient stop and variant property bindings landed (gap 14): Styles & variables breadth 85% → 92%, ready 70% → 72%, 4–8 h → 1–2 h; feature breadth unchanged (~79%); ready for real work unchanged (~47%); full parity ~385–730 h → ~380–725 h |
| 2026-10-11 | minor | Collaboration wording after the standalone server: `figcraft-server` keeps many files, persisted as a snapshot plus a log of what changed (compacted, checksummed, damaged files skipped and reported), restarts lose nothing confirmed and apps resume where they were; the app publishes its file to it; share links per file let people edit or only view (the server refuses a viewer's edits), are revocable and stored as hashes; TLS comes from a reverse proxy (the desktop app has none of its own yet); percentages and hours unchanged until the next re-measure |
| 2026-10-11 | minor | Live boolean editing, Design panel arc fields, the shape builder on strokes and open paths and one-sided variable widths landed (gap 13): Shapes & vector breadth 92% → 97%, ready 66% → 68%, 8–14 h → 1–3 h; feature breadth ~78% → ~79%; ready for real work unchanged (~47%); full parity ~390–745 h → ~385–730 h |
| 2026-10-11 | minor | Collaboration wording after the collaboration polish: styles, variables, collections, modes and comments created in a live session take ids from their creator's id space (concurrent creations no longer overwrite each other; the server checks it), others' text carets and selections show on the canvas, and typing in a layer someone else is typing in says so; percentages unchanged |
| 2026-10-11 | minor | Wording only: live sessions (#104), then the browser joining them and `figcraft://` invite links opening the desktop app; percentages and hours unchanged until the next re-measure |
| 2026-10-10 | minor | Merged main after #101–#103: WASM plugins (plugins area 0% → 35% breadth, 20% ready; ecosystem 5% → 20%) and the multiplayer core without networking (multiplayer 5% → 15% breadth, 5% ready; collaboration 8% → 12%); menu breadth 97.5% → 98.5% (200/203); ready for real work ~46% → ~47%; full parity 420–790 h → 390–745 h; beta 210–380 h → 200–365 h. Fixed the stated weight sums (areas 1–16 sum to 94, total 113; percentages were already computed with those) |
| 2026-10-10 | minor | Readiness by audience with hours to ~95% (full ~400–750, mainstream ~180–330, essentials ~85–160) |
| 2026-10-10 | minor | Added essentials user (~53%) and mainstream practitioner (~43%); ready for real work unchanged at ~46% |
| 2026-10-10 | minor | Alpha gate (core workflows) checked under the revised stage rules: passes, stays alpha |
| 2026-10-10 | major | Rewritten to the craftrules progress-docs shape after a full re-measure; rubric, area narrative and inventory moved to docs/target-app-parity.md, gaps to docs/gaps.md, milestones to docs/roadmap.md. Depth ~79% (self-graded, 16 areas) → ready for real work ~46% (all dimensions); full parity 115–195 h → 420–790 h |
| 2026-10-10 | minor | Day-2 refreshes after each batch of PRs (depth 58% → 79%) |
| 2026-10-09 | major | First roadmap |
