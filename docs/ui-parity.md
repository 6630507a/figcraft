# UI and interaction parity

> **Last reviewed:** 2026-10-10 · **Last updated:** 2026-10-11 · **Change:** minor (spell check while editing text on Windows and macOS; menu breadth 201/204) · **Target:** Figma Design UI3 (desktop app 126.10.7)

Fine canvas control is what Figma users feel first: handles, snapping, nudging, modifier keys,
drag behaviour, numeric precision. This checklist covers the tools, gestures and panels. Status:
**done** (built and checked against Figma's documented behaviour or by eye), **partial**, **missing**.
Nothing here has been compared tool by tool against the running Figma yet; that pass is the main
remaining work (40–60 h, [gaps](gaps.md) #4).

**Summary (estimated):** UI/UX fidelity ~58%. Layout and look of UI3 compared side by side (~65%);
interaction feel not yet compared.

## Revision history

| Date | Change | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-10-11 | minor | Spell check while editing text: misspelled words underlined, suggestions, Ignore and Add to dictionary in the context menu, Text ▸ Spelling ▸ Check spelling (the system's checker on Windows and macOS, in the system's language; none on Linux, FreeBSD or the web yet). Text 85% → 88% breadth, 64% → 66% ready, 8–14 h → 5–10 h; menu breadth 200/203 → 201/204 (98.5%); gap 11 narrowed to the remaining platforms and languages (4–8 h → 2–5 h); weighted percentages unchanged, hour totals down 3–4 h (headline ranges unchanged within their rounding) |
| 2026-10-10 | major | Created from the ROADMAP's look-and-feel and interaction items, the keymap and the canvas code |
